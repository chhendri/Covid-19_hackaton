# Explanation
In this file, there are three sections:
**Wishlist**,
**Doing**,
**Done**.

In **Wishlist**, everyone can add any Bullet point they think need to be done.
If you think a bullet point to be done more quickly, because you need the results, 
but don't know how to do it yourself, add an exclamation sign to add the end of that point.
This way we can prioritise more efficiently.

When you want to work on something, move the item from **Wishlist** to **Doing**, and put your name behind it.
This way, we will not do double work.

When you are ready with the bullet point, move it to **Done**.
Make sure you push any progress to the github, so other people can use it.

## General Tip
Try to make the bullet points as small as possible, this way there are a lot of pushes, information that the others can use.
Also psychologically pleasing that done group is growing.


# Wishlist

* work places and schools (a kind of routine)
* Implement probability distribution of getting infected vs Distance
	- Maybe Sigmoid?
	- Chris's note: isn't already modeled using the dot size ?
* Representing relations with graph theory?
* Get more meaningful time related units
* Use tests to test if people are sick or not, relate quarantine and hospitilised people with that

* Set a graphical interface to choose parameters
* add legends to the turtle plot
* Prepare the 2 minutes presentation for Monday

# Doing
* Write introduction for the README.md (Charlotte)
* Implement a times on the op of screen (Jan)
* set hospital priority for eldery people (Delanoe)

# Done
* Code is uploaded :)

* Population of 100 (can be changed) in a rectangle area
* Each collision has a probability of 50% to transmit the virus (can also be changed)
* There is a hospital in the middle (red circle) with a capacity of 20 patients (20% of the population, can be changed)
* We begin with a 20-years-old infected, the others have random ages
* When two people collide, they go away in opposites directions
* People goes to the hospital when the incubation period is finished and there is room for them
* Once in the hospital, people heal faster with a lower probability of dying
* In the initial population, there are 40 doctors that are able to go in the hospital. Other healthy people are not allowed to go inside.
* Dead people are still visible but don't collide, don't move and don't transmit the virus
* Added protections (masks for example), protected people has a lower probability to get or give the virus. We can choose who is protected
* Houses and quarantine

* Collect all the information that has been posted until now and put organise it in repository
